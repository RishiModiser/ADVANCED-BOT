## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

### Browser Download Fails

- **Check internet connection** is active
- **Check firewall** isn't blocking downloads
- **Try running again** - it will retry automatically
- **Manual install**: If automatic download fails repeatedly:
  ```bash
  # Windows (in Command Prompt)
  cd %USERPROFILE%\.cache\ms-playwright
  
  # Linux/Mac (in Terminal)
  cd ~/.cache/ms-playwright
  ```
  Then contact support with error details

### Application Crashes

1. **Check system resources**:
   - Close other applications
   - Ensure at least 4GB RAM available

2. **Run from terminal/command prompt** to see error messages:
   - **Windows**: Open cmd, run `ADVANCED-BOT.exe`

3. **Report the issue**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/RishiModiser/ADVANCED-BOT/issues
   - Include: OS version, error messages, steps to reproduce

### Slow Performance
